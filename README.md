# CS100 Menu Project

> Author: Sumachai Suksanguan, Karsten Fields


Me and my Partner plan on working on a Menu App, that will utilize Composite, Decorator, and Abstract Factory Design Patterns.

## Premise

Foodservice is a growing industry, and as restaurants get more and more advanced, so will the technology needed.  We believe that using these patterns to design a functional menu option that allows users to keep better track of their items and food will be much more efficient in the long run. After all, food can be composed up with many other foods, and "decorated" as well.  Using an Abstract Factory will allow for a more template-based creation of food.

This project will be coded primarily in C++.  The README. will be updated along the way, with all important aspects highlighted during the developmental process.  All inputs and outputs will be menu items that are sold primarily on the UCR Campus.  Example restaurants include Emerbees, Sizzle, Savor, and other UCR-exclusive restaurants.
